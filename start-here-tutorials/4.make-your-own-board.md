# Make your own board
The autors of the original (and awesome) board (Max Pfeiffer and Tim Dünte) have prepared a very comprehensible tutorial on how to use the Eagle files to make your own board.

Please refer to their tutorial:

## Part list

For the openEMSstim version add a 1N4001-like SMD diode (in SMB size) such as one of the ones below:

## Notes on making a openEMSstim:
Currently the openEMSstim differs only slightly from the original board.We added a diode to protect the battery in case you accidentally reserve the polarity. 

## Preview of upcoming versions:
In the upcoming versions we altered a bit more, here's a preview of what's coming up: 

1. Altered the input and output connectors
2. Added a recheargeable lipo battery instead of a 9V block
3. Added a 5V voltage regulator instead of using the built-in from the arduino.  
4. No entire arduino (smaller package)

Note that this is an open source project, so feel free to send pull requests with your features, mods, etc!
